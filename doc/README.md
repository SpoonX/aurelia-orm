# Aurelia-orm

Working with endpoints and client-side entities is unavoidable when doing API driven development. You end up writing a small wrapper for your XHRs / websocket events and putting your request methods in one place.
Another option is just using Breeze, which is large, complex and not meant for most applications. Even though your endpoints are important, you still end up neglecting them.

Enter aurelia-orm. This module provides you with some useful and cool features, such as:

* Entity definitions
* Repositories
* Associations
* Type casting
* Self-populating select element
* And more

This makes it easier to focus on your application and organize your code.
